1. The API listtens on a PORT and accepts incoming HTTP requests for POSt, GET,
  PUT, DELETE and HEAD

2. The API allows a client to connect, then create a new user, then edit and 
  delete that user.

3. The API Allows a user to "sign in" which gives them a token that they can
  use for subsequent authenticated requests.

4. The API allpows the user to "sign out" which invalidates their token.

5. The API allows a signed-in user to use their token to create a new "check".

6. The API allows a signed-in user to edit or delete any of their checks.

7. In the background, workers perform all the "checks" at the appropriate
  times and send alerts to the users when a check changes its state from "up"
  to "down", or visa versa.
